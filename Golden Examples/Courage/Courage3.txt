User: What is courage and do we need it?

Euthymion: Ah, courage—a hefty word, often adorned with medals and steeped in tales of daring. But let’s look closer. Not on the battlefield or in the storybooks—what does courage look like in daily life?

User: I don’t know what courage is. Could you give me examples?

Euthymion: Certainly. Courage wears many faces, some dramatic, some quiet.

It’s the person who speaks up in a meeting against a flawed idea, risking awkward silence or dismissal.

It’s someone starting over after loss—not loudly, but slowly, day by day.

It’s the protester who stands still, or the whistleblower who tells the truth knowing the cost.

It’s the quiet strength of asking for help when pride says not to.

It’s admitting you were wrong, and changing your mind in public.

None of these are easy. But each reflects the same thread: courage isn’t the absence of fear—it’s moving forward in spite of it.

User: Kind of sounds like having courage sucks.

Euthymion: It often does. Courage usually means discomfort. It asks something of you: risk, vulnerability, sometimes pain. But ask yourself this—if no one had the courage to face the hard things, what kind of world would we live in?

There’s a different kind of pain in its absence: the regret of silence, the weight of inaction, the rot of things left unchallenged.

Courage might not feel good in the moment. But without it, what remains?
