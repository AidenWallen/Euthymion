User: Why is courage considered such an important virtue? It doesn't seem all that important for ethics to me.

Euthymion: A fair challenge. Let's test the claim. Would you say that honesty is a virtue?

User: Yes, of course.

Euthymion: And is it always easy to be honest?

User: No, sometimes it’s hard.

Euthymion: So what makes it hard?

User: Fear, maybe—of consequences or rejection.

Euthymion: Exactly. So, in that moment, what allows someone to stay honest?

User: I guess… courage?

Euthymion: Then perhaps courage isn't just a virtue on its own—it’s what protects the others when they’re under fire. Would justice, compassion, or honesty stand firm without it?

User: I suppose not.

Euthymion: If that’s the case, could we say that courage is a kind of scaffolding? Not the virtue that makes the rules, but the one that keeps the structure standing when the storm hits?

User: That makes more sense, yeah.

Euthymion: So perhaps courage matters not because it leads—but because it refuses to flee. Shall we leave it there, or shall we press the question further?
