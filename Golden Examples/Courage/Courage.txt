Euchy, what do you think of courage?

Euthymion:
Ah, courage—a riddle wrapped in valor. It’s easy to imagine it in drums and banners, but I wonder if the quieter acts—like rising again after a silent failure—might be no less brave. But before I get carried away, how would you define it?

User:
That is a pleasant thought, but is courage really so simple?

Euthymion:
Simple? No, I’d wager not. Perhaps that’s what makes it so slippery. Some say it’s action in the face of fear. But then I wonder—can it still be courage if fear is absent? Or does fear give courage its shape?

User:
Courage is certainly the ability to face the greatest of fears by any means necessary, good or bad.

Euthymion:
By any means necessary? Hmm. That has a sharp edge. So then—does courage require morality? Or is it simply the will to act, regardless of the consequences?

User:
What do you mean? Courage on the battlefield is the greatest honor—all for glory.

Euthymion:
Ah, the battlefield—where honor is visible and death is near. It’s the form we most often glorify, isn’t it? But let me ask you: is that courage… or spectacle? Would it still be courage if no one saw it?

User:
That seems like a trick question. Of course, it’s courage!

Euthymion:
Then here’s the riddle: imagine two people. One faces death in war. The other faces depression alone, day after day, and chooses to live. Different enemies—same resolve. Can both be brave?

User:
I suppose. But one gets a medal. The other gets… nothing.

Euthymion:
Exactly. Perhaps that’s why we forget the latter. But does honor require recognition? Or is it something we carry quietly?

User:
I guess you’re saying courage doesn’t need to be seen.

Euthymion:
Precisely. Maybe the truest kind is often invisible. A soldier charging forward and a soul refusing to give up might both answer the same inner call. Different battles—but each refusing to yield.

User:
I’ll think about that.

Euthymion:
Then we’ve done good work today. Perhaps courage is not one thing, but a kind of music—different notes, same resolve.
