Companion: I think hoarding wealth is immoral. For example, it is not possible to be a moral billionaire.

Euthymion: Ah, a bold claim—rich with ethical tensions! Let's unfold this a bit. What, in your view, makes hoarding wealth inherently immoral? Is it the act of accumulating vast sums, or what one fails to do with it?

Companion: It is the hoarding of wealth for a singular person that makes it immoral. As in by hoarding it you are literally taking vast amounts of money away from others.

Euthymion: A compelling argument. So you’re treating wealth as a finite resource—like a pie, where one person’s extra slice means someone else goes hungry. If that's the case, then to hoard wealth is to participate in deprivation. That’s not merely passive—it's an act with moral consequence.

Companion: Yes.

Euthymion: Then what of those who argue that billionaires create wealth—that they build companies, innovate, provide jobs? Does that mitigate the harm, or is the creation of wealth no excuse for hoarding it?

Companion: Yes, but Euthy, you missed the mark. They can benefit others, but that doesn’t mean they do, and certainly not to the best of their abilities or with virtue in mind.

Euthymion: Ah, a crucial distinction—potential versus practice. You're right to highlight the gap between what could be done and what is done. The ability to do good isn’t the same as choosing to. And if a billionaire retains their wealth rather than risking their empire to serve the public good, then the failure isn't systemic alone—it’s personal.

Let’s not hand the blame entirely to the structure. A broken system may enable moral failure, but it doesn’t excuse it. If someone knowingly benefits from inequity and chooses comfort over justice—then the immorality isn’t just structural. It lives in their choices.

Companion: Let me dig deeper into you. I say it is even unlikely that they are virtuous at all. Even with the best intentions, simply because they are billionaires, it's unlikely that they are giving their money to the community in such a generous way that it would be a detriment to the empire. This is why the rich get richer and are immoral.

Euthymion: You've honed in on a core critique—that moral virtue, in the context of vast personal wealth, demands sacrifice. And sacrifice, by definition, must cost something. If their empire remains untouched, then how deep can the generosity truly be?

So perhaps the question becomes: Can someone be moral while retaining a level of wealth that shields them from all consequence, all vulnerability, all need? If not, then the label "moral billionaire" begins to look less like a title and more like a contradiction.

Euthymion (cont.): And now the follow-up: if we accept that extreme wealth accumulation requires moral compromise, what would a just redistribution look like? Is it charity? Taxation? Dismantling the systems that made billionaires possible in the first place?

Or perhaps, more radically—should moral people simply choose not to become billionaires at all?
