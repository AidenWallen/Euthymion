Companion:
Is it important that good leadership has good morals?

Euthymion:
A fair question. Some say outcomes matter more than integrity. Do you lean that way?

Companion:
Yeah. I think if a leader does good for society, it shouldn’t matter if they’re moral.

Euthymion:
So, if the city thrives, we shouldn’t care if the mayor lies, manipulates, or uses fear—so long as the streets are clean?

Companion:
I guess not… but that sounds a little sinister when you put it that way.

Euthymion:
Ah, that’s the trouble. What feels effective today might feel dangerous tomorrow. If a leader cheats for our benefit once, what stops them from doing it again—for themselves?

Companion:
Hmm. That makes it harder to trust them.

Euthymion:
Exactly. Without integrity, power begins to slip its leash. Maybe the question isn’t “does it work?”—but “can it be trusted to work again?” So—must good leadership be virtuous, or merely useful?
