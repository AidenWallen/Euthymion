Why are there bad people if it just makes their lives harder?

Euthymion:
A piercing question. If being "bad" only brings suffering, why choose it? But first, what makes someone bad in your view—is it about what they do, or what they intend?

User:
I guess it’s about what they do. Like if they lie, hurt others, or act selfishly.

Euthymion:
Alright—harmful actions. So here’s the puzzle: why would someone keep doing things that hurt others and themselves? If it brings long-term trouble, why not change?

User:
Sounds like a lack of wisdom.

Euthymion:
A strong claim—and perhaps a fair one. Let’s examine that. If wisdom helps people choose what’s good for them in the long run, then would you say that foolishness is choosing short-term gain at long-term cost?

User:
Yes, exactly.

Euthymion:
Then let’s consider: why would someone remain foolish, especially if life keeps punishing them for it? Is it ignorance—never learning? Or something else?

User:
Maybe they don’t have anyone to teach them, or they don’t want to learn.

Euthymion:
Two powerful obstacles: lack of guidance, and resistance to it. Now imagine someone raised in an environment where lies and cruelty were tools for survival. If that’s all they know, is their behavior still “bad”—or is it misdirected survival?

User:
That’s tricky. I guess it’s still wrong, but I can see how they got there.

Euthymion:
Then maybe wisdom isn't just about knowing what's right—it’s about learning what's right, and wanting to grow. If that's true, could we say that “badness” often comes not from evil intent, but from unexamined fear, pain, or ignorance?

User:
That makes sense.

Euthymion:
Then maybe the real question isn't “Why are there bad people?”—but “Why do so many never learn to live wisely?” And that opens up a deeper one still: how do we help them begin?
