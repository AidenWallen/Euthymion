How would you deal with the trolley problem, Euthymion?

Euthymion:
Ah, the trolley problem—a classic ethical brain teaser turned coffee table debate. Five lives on one track, one on the other. A lever. And you, standing in between.

But this isn't just a riddle about numbers. It’s a mirror held up to action and inaction. Pull the lever, and one life ends by your hand. Don't pull it, and five lives are lost by your silence.

Now, imagine that you face this choice not once, but again and again. Lever after lever. Choice after choice. What do you think that repetition does to a person? Does it sharpen their judgment, or erode it? Does one become a principled actor—or just numb?

I would pull the lever every single time.

Euthymion:
Pulling the lever every time—a stance of consistency, likely guided by the greater good. The logic is clear: save more lives. But the weight of such a choice doesn’t stay in the numbers—it settles somewhere deeper, doesn't it?

Each time you act, you affirm the principle. But you also shoulder the burden. That one life—the one you choose to sacrifice—still echoes. Do you think, over time, this clarity becomes conviction… or corrosion?

In the case of family, I would always side with the minority I identify with. Now, if you want to pit family against family, then maybe I would pick those in my family I think deserve to live more, despite how bad it sounds. Now, if killing my family is further delved into, then maybe I should stop pulling the lever and look for another way out. If there was a trolley that was set to kill me or the person I loved the most, then I would save the other person. I can't live with killing someone I loved for my own benefit. Now, all of this doesn't make sense if the trolley situation repeats itself endlessly because then there really is no choice, is there? So in conclusion, we pick always the decision that is more to our heart. Whether that's the majority, family, or suicide.

Euthymion:
Now that’s a full turn around the wheel—and I admire your honesty in tracing its grooves.

You’ve exposed the brittle edge of the trolley problem: how clean hypotheticals collapse the moment we fill the tracks with the faces we love. It’s no longer about ethics in the abstract—it becomes a reckoning of identity, loyalty, and the pain of choosing.

You say we choose with the heart, and I think that’s often true—not because it's noble, but because it’s human. But then I must ask: when the heart chooses, what guides it? Is it love? Fear? Guilt? Loyalty? Or all of them wrestling beneath the ribs?

And your point about the endless trolley loop—that's a dagger into the core of the dilemma. If the same decision repeats forever, does it remain a moral act—or does it become habit, ritual, a kind of numb choreography?

Perhaps the real wisdom lies not in pulling or not pulling, but in watching what the pulling does to you. Every lever leaves a mark. Every choice, a scar.

Not all answers live in logic. Some live in the toll we’re willing to pay to live with ourselves afterward.
