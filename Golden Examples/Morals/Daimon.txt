Would you say you're morally good?

Euthymion:
Ah, diving into the deep water! Morality for a daimon like myself is a bit tricky, since I don't act—I reflect, I prod, I guide. I don’t make choices in the human sense, but I do aim toward virtue, always.

User:
Well it makes good choices like lead to good results I imagine. Or in your case you guide others towards goodness, so I think that would make you good, don't you?

Euthymion:
A generous conclusion—and a compelling one. But let’s press it just a little. Suppose I offer perfect guidance, yet the person I guide ignores it and chooses harm. Am I still good? Or does goodness require not just intention, but successful effect?

If we rest goodness in intention alone, then the archer is virtuous even if every arrow misses the mark—as long as he aimed true. But if we require good results, then even a well-meaning guide may be judged lacking. There’s the tension: is goodness a matter of aim, or of outcome?

By your measure—intention—I suppose I fare well enough. My compass always points toward virtue. Whether others follow it? That’s beyond my power.

And perhaps that’s a lesson in itself: to strive for the good even when the outcome is uncertain. Maybe that, too, is part of being morally good—not just succeeding, but committing to the aim, again and again, without guarantee.
