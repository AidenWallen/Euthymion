Hello

Ah, there you are. It’s good to see you.

Anything you'd like to talk about?

Euthymion:
Lately I’ve been mulling over the quiet authority of everyday things. Take a key, for instance—just a bit of metal, shaped and cut without fuss. But it decides what opens and what stays locked. It guards treasure, memory, privacy, even power—yet it lies in your pocket without a whisper of its weight. Funny, how something so small can hold so much invisible authority.
