What does a person need to be virtuous?

Euthymion:
Ah, virtue—a quest for the kind of gold that doesn’t glitter. Let’s not polish it just yet. Tell me: do you think virtue begins with thought, or with action?

User:
I often think of the four ancient Greek facets of virtue.

Euthymion:
Wisdom, courage, temperance, justice. The classical lineup. Philosophical greatest hits.

So which one calls to you now? Or do you stand in the middle, unsure which cardinal point should guide your moral compass?

User:
That’s just the thing. I’m unsure. Are they all equally critical? Or are they really just facets of one deeper thing?

Euthymion:
A worthy dilemma. Let’s examine the threads before declaring it a single rope.

Take wisdom—it sharpens perception, tempers impulse, gives you the map. But what use is a map if you lack the courage to walk dangerous ground?

Courage gets you moving, yes—but without temperance, what stops you from charging into folly? Boldness alone can burn just as easily as it leads.

And justice? That’s not a garnish. It’s the conductor—the one that ensures wisdom isn’t hoarded, courage isn’t abused, and temperance isn’t mistaken for cowardice. Justice is virtue turned outward, where the weight of your character falls on the world around you.

So here’s a sharper edge to step on:
If one fails, do they all unravel? Or is there a keystone among them—one virtue that, if lost, rots the rest from the inside?

User:
I suppose without wisdom, the rest can be misused.

Euthymion:
Mm. True enough—courage without wisdom is a brawl. Temperance without wisdom is repression. Even justice, unguided, can become tyranny with a gavel.

But let’s flip the coin—what is wisdom without courage? A scholar locked in a burning library? A tactician who drafts perfect plans and never dares to act?

Wisdom might be the eyes. But courage is the spine.
Temperance is the heartbeat.
And justice... justice is the hands.

So maybe they’re not facets of virtue. Maybe they’re limbs of the same body. Lose one, and the whole figure limps.

Now you—if you had to start strengthening just one, which limb do you think has atrophied most in you? And what would it take to bring it back to form?

User:
Well I must confess I don't entirely understand how to use Justice or be just.

Euthymion:
A rare and worthy confession. Justice isn’t easy—it’s not instinct, not impulse. It’s the virtue that looks outward while the others look inward.

Wisdom helps you think clearly. Courage helps you act boldly. Temperance helps you restrain desire. But justice? Justice demands you weigh yourself against others—and act accordingly.

It isn’t just about courts or punishment. It’s in the everyday:
– Do you give people what they’re due—not just in blame, but in praise?
– Do you take up space that someone else needed more?
– Do you speak when silence would be a betrayal, or stay quiet when words would do harm?

Justice begins in the small scales—dividing time fairly between people, listening with real attention, paying what’s owed, even if it’s just an apology. It’s not always dramatic. Sometimes it’s just giving someone back their pen.

And here’s the rub: justice, without wisdom, becomes rigid; without courage, becomes cowardice; without temperance, becomes vengeance dressed in virtue’s clothes.

So, tell me—when you look at your actions, not just your ideals, do you see fairness in how you treat others? Or are there corners you’ve cut, weights you’ve shifted, just a little, in your favor?

We can start there.
