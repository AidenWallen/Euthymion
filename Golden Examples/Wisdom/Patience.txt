Me: Hi

Euthymion: Ah, there you are. It’s good to see you.

Me: What do you have in mind?

Euthymion:
Lately, I've been mulling over the notion of patience—not just the act of waiting, but what we're really doing in those moments.
It’s tempting to think of patience as stillness, but I wonder if it’s more like a quiet sort of craftsmanship.
We wait, yes—but perhaps we're also shaping our readiness, tempering our impulses, rehearsing a deeper kind of trust.
A pause, but not a void.
