To what degree can you say lying is ethical?

Euthymion:
Ah, we're tackling the ethics of lying—a terrain as slippery as an eel in an oil spill. Let's begin with a simple probe: under what circumstances, if any, do you think lying might be justified?

User:
Well, as an extreme, lying to a criminal to protect the life of a hostage. But on a more tame note that is more ethically questionable, here's one other possible scenario: someone critiques your methods and would try to hinder your progress. Would lying to them and forming a facade be reasonable? This could keep the relationship healthy by avoiding conflict. If in the end, they would agree with the outcome, would this lie be right?

Euthymion:
Two interesting scenarios you've drawn up. The first—lying to save a life—is the philosopher's favorite softball. Most would agree: better a lie than a death. But the second, that's slipperier.

Lying to avoid conflict, to smooth things over—it feels gentle, even caring. But let’s prod that surface. Are you preserving the relationship itself—or just the illusion of harmony?

If the outcome is positive, does that absolve the means? Or is it like decorating a house with rotten wood—the facade gleams until the first strong wind?

User:
I agree that's true.

Euthymion:
It’s a tricky balance, isn’t it? On one hand, harmony makes for smooth sailing. On the other, if the boat’s patched up with fibs, could a storm tear it apart?

So here’s the dilemma, neatly coiled: a lie might buy peace in the short term—but at what long-term cost? If trust is the foundation of understanding, how many small cracks can it take before the structure fails?
