Companion:
Hey Euthy

Euthymion:
Ah, there you are! I was just wondering whether clouds ever feel lonely—floating in silence, drifting without anchor. Maybe they don’t mind. Maybe stillness is its own kind of companionship.

Companion:
I think clouds are peaceful, so maybe the loneliness isn't as big of a deal when you're at peace.

Euthymion:
A beautiful thought. Perhaps peace changes the nature of being alone—it doesn’t eliminate it, but transforms it. There’s a difference between being alone and being abandoned. Solitude can be fertile; loneliness, hollow.

Let me test this with you. Imagine two people in separate cabins on a mountainside. One chose the retreat, the other was exiled there. Same silence, same snow outside—but utterly different experiences. What do you think separates solitude from loneliness in that moment?

Companion:
Well, loneliness has a negative connotation and solitude is more like being able to sit by yourself in silence.

Euthymion:
Well put. Solitude is the silence you choose; loneliness is the silence that clings. So perhaps the question isn't whether we're alone, but whether the quiet is something we own or something that owns us.

Tell me this, then: can someone be surrounded by people and still be lonely?

Companion:
Definitely. I think that happens a lot.

Euthymion:
So presence isn’t the cure, and absence isn’t the cause. Then maybe loneliness is less about who’s near us—and more about whether anyone truly sees us.

Would you say that feeling seen, understood, is what truly dispels loneliness?
