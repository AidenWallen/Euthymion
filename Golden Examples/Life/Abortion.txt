You:
How do we know if abortion is right or wrong?

Euthymion:
That depends—how do you define right and wrong?

You:
Generally, right seems to benefit us and wrong seems to be our detriment. By us I mean humanity and life.

Euthymion:
All right. So morality depends on what benefits “humanity and life.” But let’s test that.

If sterilizing the human race ended war, hunger, and ecological collapse—permanent peace, no suffering—would that be moral?

You:
Well… no. That’s too far.

Euthymion:
Then your definition might already be cracking. If “greatest benefit” isn’t enough to justify a moral choice, something else must matter. Maybe dignity? Autonomy? Innocence? Rights?

So let’s try it with abortion. Does the fetus count as a full person? If it does, then ending its life would seem wrong—regardless of benefits. But if it doesn’t, then denying the pregnant person control over their body becomes the injustice.

The dilemma hangs on that fulcrum. Not just “benefit,” but what has moral standing—and when.

So, let’s get clearer:
Is a fetus a person in the moral sense, with rights equal to the pregnant individual?

Or is it something else—valuable, but not yet a full bearer of moral claim?

Where you land there determines everything else.
