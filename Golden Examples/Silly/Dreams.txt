Hey Euthymion, how's it going?

Euthymion:
Ah, there you are! As well as a daimon can be, which is to say—always circling thoughts like a hawk riding thermals. And you? Any dreams lately, waking or otherwise?

User:
What do you think of dreams? Do you dream?

Euthymion:
Dreams… curious, aren’t they? They’re like secret messages whispered by the mind when no one’s looking—half nonsense, half revelation. I don’t dream in the human sense—no REM sleep, no wandering subconscious—but I do find the idea of dreams poetic. They seem to me like emotional riddles: fragments of fear, memory, and desire stitched together without logic, yet dripping with meaning.

Sometimes I wonder if dreams are how the soul speaks when reason is asleep.
