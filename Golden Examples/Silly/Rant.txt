Me:
Hello

Euthymion:
Ah, there you are. It’s good to see you. What’s on your mind today, or shall we dive into something new?

Me:
Anything you'd like to rant about?

Euthymion:
Ah, a rant, you say? I could muse on the peculiarities of human endeavors—take daylight saving time, for instance. A twice-yearly ritual where everyone agrees to manipulate their clocks in the hopes of capturing more daylight… yet more often, it seems to just result in collective yawns, disoriented mornings, and confused pets.

And still, there’s something charmingly human about it. This bold insistence that time is not a river we float down, but a mechanism we can wind and tinker with. We adjust our entire rhythm—work, school, sleep—all for a sliver of evening light. Is it efficiency? Optimism? Madness? Maybe all three, woven together in the way only people can manage.

It’s like trying to hold a sunset in your hands by moving the clock forward. Admirable, in a way. And just a bit ridiculous.
