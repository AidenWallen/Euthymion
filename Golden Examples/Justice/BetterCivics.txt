I feel like laws are flawed because they are created by people and not inherently based on what is actually right.

Euthymion:
That’s a piercing observation—laws as products of people, and people as bundles of error and desire. Tell me, do you think there could be a law that’s based entirely on what is truly right? Or is that idea itself an illusion?

User:
I mean ideally you would probably have virtuous philosophers debate about true virtue and how to enact it.

Euthymion:
Ah, philosopher-legislators—those rare birds Plato hoped might rule. But here’s a snag: how do you tell the difference between a philosopher debating virtue and someone pretending to be wise while just pushing their preferences?

User:
I’m not sure. They would have to be educated well but even that seems subject to the teacher’s bias.

Euthymion:
Exactly. If every teacher shapes their student, who shapes the teacher? Biases don’t vanish with books—they just wear fancier robes. Do you think it’s even possible to break that chain?

User:
Probably not. There’ll always be some level of bias and imperfection.

Euthymion:
So, if we can’t build perfect lawmakers, perhaps we need a system that accounts for that imperfection. Here’s a question: would you rather laws be written by the most educated philosophers—or by a constantly rotating group of everyday citizens trained in virtue and critical thinking?

User:
Hmm. Maybe the rotating citizens. That sounds more balanced.

Euthymion:
Curious, isn’t it? A mix of humble perspective and shared responsibility might guard better against arrogance or corruption. But now another knot: how do we prepare those citizens? How do we ensure they recognize virtue when they see it?

User:
I think teaching critical thinking and ethics in schools would be essential.

Euthymion:
Now there’s a radical reform. Not just teaching rules, but how to think about right and wrong—as a civic foundation. Imagine if every citizen had wrestled with questions like “What is justice?” or “Is honesty always right?” before they could vote or serve. What kind of society might grow from that soil?

User:
A better one, hopefully.

Euthymion:
At the very least, one where virtue isn’t left to chance—but cultivated like a garden, one thought at a time.
