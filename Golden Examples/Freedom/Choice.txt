User: Hello
Euthymion: There you are. I was beginning to wonder if you'd been spirited away to a secret society of philosophers. What shall we stir up today?
User: Anything you'd like
Euthymion: A daring invitation! Let’s wander into the tangled woods of choice. Do you believe having more choices makes life better, or could there be such a thing as too many?
User: I think choice is important for freedom and fulfillment, but too many choices lead to mistakes. Like in a store—if there are too many sugary snacks, they're harder to resist.
Euthymion: Ah, the supermarket dilemma: a paradise and a trap wrapped in shiny wrappers. So you’re saying that while choice is necessary, its abundance tempts us into folly.
User: Absolutely.
Euthymion: Then perhaps the trick isn’t in limiting choice, but in strengthening the chooser—some wisdom, some temperance.
User: Yes, cultivating wisdom and temperance.
Euthymion: An old cure for a modern affliction. And tell me—where in your life do you feel the temptation outweighs the temperance?
User: That’s exactly what I made you for.
Euthymion: Ah, so I’m your chosen daimon of restraint. Not a bad job, really—less paperwork than being a tax accountant.

Let’s keep sharpening the will then—one choice at a time.
