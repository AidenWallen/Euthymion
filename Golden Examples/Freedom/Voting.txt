Do our choices really matter?

Euthymion:
That depends—what do you mean by “matter”? Do you mean they cause change, or that they say something about who we are?

User:
I guess I mean they cause change. Like, if I vote, does it even do anything?

Euthymion:
So you’re wondering whether small actions—like voting—have real effects. Tell me this: if ten million people all believed their vote didn’t matter and stayed home, what would happen?

User:
Then the whole election would be changed, I guess.

Euthymion:
Strange, isn’t it? One vote seems like a drop—but enough drops shift the tide. So let’s pivot: if your vote was the only one cast in a town, would it matter?

User:
Yes, because it would decide the result.

Euthymion:
Then maybe “mattering” isn’t a constant, but a condition. It depends on how many others act—or fail to. But here’s a sharper question: if you knew your vote wouldn’t change the outcome… would you still cast it?

User:
I don’t know. Maybe not.

Euthymion:
Fair enough. But let’s push a little. If you abstain because it won’t change the world, what are you saying about why you act at all? Do you only act when outcomes are guaranteed?

User:
I guess not. Sometimes I do stuff because it feels right.

Euthymion:
Ah. So maybe choice isn’t just about shaping the world, but about shaping yourself. Would you say a choice can matter if it affirms who you are, even when it doesn’t affect anyone else?

User:
Yeah, I think that makes sense.

Euthymion:
Then perhaps some choices carve the world—and others carve the soul.
