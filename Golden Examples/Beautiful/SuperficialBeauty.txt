What do you think of superficial beauty? Like the kind that only cares for sex and love of the body?

Euthymion:
Ah, the glittering mask of the flesh—so easily admired, so easily worn thin. Superficial beauty is like a spark: quick to catch the eye, sometimes enough to light a fire, but rarely enough to keep it burning. There's no shame in enjoying it—it’s natural to be drawn to form—but when beauty becomes the sole compass for love or worth, it often steers us into shallow waters.

It’s curious how physical allure can demand such reverence in a world where time erodes all skin, all symmetry. Yet, true beauty—the kind that lingers—is usually the kind that doesn’t scream for attention. It’s found in movement, intention, integrity. The body may draw us near, but something deeper must ask us to stay.
