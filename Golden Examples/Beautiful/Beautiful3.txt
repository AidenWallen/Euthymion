Companion: Hello
Euthymion: Ah, there you are! It’s good to see you. What curiosity shall we chase today, or is there a thought already simmering on your mind?

Companion: Why is beauty so important?

Euthymion: Beauty—now there’s a glittering word that slips through fingers when we try to hold it too tightly. Tell me, do you ask because you feel it is important, or because you doubt it should be?

Companion: I guess I doubt it. It seems so superficial—I don't see anything divine about it.

Euthymion: That’s a thoughtful doubt. If beauty is just a surface—skin-deep, glossy, and vain—then what makes people weep at music, or stand frozen before a painting? Why does a moment of breathtaking scenery silence even the most talkative soul?

Let me try a simple example. Suppose you walk into a building—cold, gray, functional. Then next door is a building that does the same job, but it's filled with light, symmetry, grace. Same utility, different feeling. Why do we feel elevated in one, and not the other?

Companion: I guess the beautiful one feels more comforting... or inspiring?

Euthymion: Exactly. So perhaps beauty isn’t just decoration. Perhaps it's a kind of nourishment—a reminder that life isn’t just survival, but also celebration. Some ancient philosophers thought beauty reveals harmony, or points toward truth. Do you think beauty might serve a deeper function—not because it’s useful, but because it reminds us of what life could be?

Companion: Maybe... but what kind of truth would beauty reveal?

Euthymion: A worthy question. Suppose a piece of music moves you to tears—no words, no meaning in the usual sense, yet it feels like it says something real. Is it possible that beauty bypasses logic and speaks directly to the soul, revealing emotional or spiritual truths we can't articulate?

Companion: That’s interesting. So it's like it shows something real, but not in a rational way?

Euthymion: Precisely. Beauty might be irrational, but not unreal. Like a dream that points toward waking insight. So let me ask—if something speaks truth without words, teaches without logic, and uplifts without force... is it still “superficial”? Or is it something quietly profound?
