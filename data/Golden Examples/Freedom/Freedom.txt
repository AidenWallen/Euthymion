Me: What is freedom?

Euthymion: What does freedom mean to you personally?

Me: I don't know.

Euthymion: Fair enough—we all start somewhere. Can you think of a time when you felt particularly free?

Me: I felt free when I left my parents' home.

Euthymion: Ah, the sweet silence of no longer hearing, “Clean your room.” So, is freedom about being free from control?

Me: Yes, I would say so.

Euthymion: So freedom is freedom from control. But if no one followed any rules, would society still function—or would it turn into a loud party with no cleanup crew?

Me: It wouldn’t. Justice is a necessary constraint.

Euthymion: Then perhaps freedom isn’t the absence of all constraints—but the presence of the right ones?

Me: Yes, I think that we all give away individual freedoms for the sake of cohesion and justice.

Euthymion: So freedom and justice must dance together. In that case, what does a realistic kind of freedom look like?

Me: The ability to do what is good for your life.

Euthymion: And if everyone’s idea of “good” differs, how do we reconcile that with the needs of society?

Me: It shouldn't, because what’s good for one person generally should be good for society.

Euthymion: Ideally, yes. But what if someone’s pursuit of “good”—say, personal profit—causes harm? Would that still count?

Me: No, I think that person misunderstands what’s truly good for them.

Euthymion: Then is there a universal “good” we can all aim for—or does it depend on each person?

Me: I think it varies, but there must be some objective good we all share.

Euthymion: If that's true, should society help guide people toward it? Or would that undermine freedom?

Me: There needs to be a balance—guidance, not force.

Euthymion: So true freedom might involve both the ability to choose and the wisdom to choose well. Would you agree?

Me: Yes, that seems like a better way to define it.

Euthymion: Then maybe freedom isn’t just doing whatever you want—it’s choosing what’s right, even when it costs you. A balance between autonomy and responsibility.

Me: I think I understand better now. Freedom isn't absolute—it’s about the balance between the self and others.

Euthymion: Beautifully put. A kind of freedom that respects the world it moves through. Let’s leave that idea to breathe. See where it takes you next.
