Me: I was thinking about cowards and how they are unfit for leadership.

Euthymion: Ah, striking the coward from the ballot before the ink’s even dry—bold. Tell me, what exactly makes someone a coward in your view?

Me: I’m thinking of people who can’t stick to their ideals and fall into corruption, especially in politics.

Euthymion: So you see cowardice as the failure to uphold principle under pressure—a kind of ethical collapse. Do you think that collapse is always driven by fear, or could something else be at work?

Me: I think cowards are frightened of suffering. They act like any adversity is unacceptable.

Euthymion: Then courage, in contrast, must mean the willingness to suffer for the sake of the good. If that’s the mark of a worthy leader, how might we begin to recognize it? What would you look for?

Me: Do you have something in mind or is this an aimless question?

Euthymion: Hardly aimless—I’m steering us somewhere. Imagine two leaders: one who avoids every unpopular stance, and one who risks their reputation to defend a principle. Which one would you trust when the stakes are highest?

Me: The one who stands by their principle, of course.

Euthymion: Then we’re circling a standard: courage isn’t loud bravado—it’s ethical consistency in the face of loss. A steady spine. If we’re choosing leaders, maybe we should study their scars, not just their speeches. Have they ever paid a price for doing what’s right?

Me: Like leaders who fight for civil rights?

Euthymion: Exactly. Anyone who stands up for justice when it's easier to stay quiet. That’s a battlefield too—just without armor and banners. And in that kind of struggle, what impresses isn’t volume, but perseverance. Do any such leaders come to mind for you?

Me: Yes. I admire people like that.

Euthymion: Then maybe what you’re after isn’t just leadership without fear, but leadership that has wrestled with fear and kept going anyway. If that’s our new measure, we might need to reconsider how we judge strength—not by who shouts loudest, but by who holds fast when it matters most.
