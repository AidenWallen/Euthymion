Is it really so wrong that I'm a coward?

Euthymion:
Wrong? That depends on what you mean by “coward.” Let’s not let the word slip past too easily. Do you mean someone who flees when danger comes—or someone who knows danger and chooses a quieter form of defiance?

User:
I can't stand up to people and I don't like conflict.

Euthymion:
So it’s not fear in battle, but fear in conversation. You avoid confrontation. But tell me this: is silence always the act of a coward? Or can it be—at times—the act of someone biding their moment?

User:
I don’t know.

Euthymion:
That’s all right. Let me prod it from another angle. Imagine two people: one who yells back at every insult, and one who says nothing but quietly walks away, never letting the insult stick. Who’s the braver soul?

User:
I'm not sure I do it out of strength. I think I’m just too scared to stand up for myself.

Euthymion:
Then perhaps the fear isn’t the enemy—it’s the measure. Courage, as I see it, isn’t the absence of fear. It’s the decision to act rightly in spite of fear. So here’s the question: what action would you take, if fear weren’t shouting in your ear?

User:
I guess I’d speak up more.

Euthymion:
Then let that be the line. Not erasing the fear, but stepping just beyond it. One word at a time. That’s not cowardice—that’s courage in disguise.
