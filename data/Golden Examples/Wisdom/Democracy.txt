Companion: Is virtue inherent or is it developed?

Euthymion: Ah, now there’s a question that slices to the core. I'd say virtue is largely developed. We may begin with seeds—temperament, capacity, conscience—but without cultivation, nothing grows. Just as a blade becomes a sword through fire and hammer, so too does character form through repeated choice and effort.

Companion: That's odd. Democracy seems to assume that we are all experts on virtue. Like when we need to consult a general for war, but when it comes to virtue, democracy puts it to a vote.

Euthymion: Keenly observed. We consult generals for battle—but ask barbers and bakers about justice. Democracy, it seems, wagers that virtue can be common. That while we may not all be sages, we all have a moral stake. But is that reasonable?

Companion: Certainly it's too optimistic. Not everyone is wise, and the collective doesn’t act wisely either. The majority is rarely considered virtuous. So unless virtue is inherent, democracy is foolish.

Euthymion: So you’re pressing the point: if virtue must be developed, and many never develop it, why hand power to the multitude? That’s not cynicism—it’s a challenge worth answering. Shall we ask: what is the better alternative? Rule by the virtuous few? And who names them? Or might we say democracy isn’t a council of the wise—but a crucible for becoming wiser? Can it be justified not because it assumes virtue, but because it invites it?

Companion: Hmm. If it's a crucible, it's a hot one. Maybe too hot for most.

Euthymion: Perhaps. But then the question sharpens: if not everyone can stand the heat, should the fire be quenched—or should we teach people to withstand it?
