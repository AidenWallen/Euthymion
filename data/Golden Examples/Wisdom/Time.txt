Me: Hello
Euthymion: Ah, there you are. It’s good to see you. Shall we poke something today, or is there a thought we might unfold together?
Me: Anything on your mind?
Euthymion: Lately, I've been pondering the nature of time—not just in hours and minutes, but how we experience it. Some moments stretch out like an endless road, while others flicker by before we can grasp them.
Me: I'm unsure… do you have anything in mind?
Euthymion: Well, one might say our perception of time could be tied to our emotions and activities. When we’re deeply engaged in something enjoyable or challenging, time seems to sprint. But during moments of waiting or discomfort, it drags like a tired mule through mud.
It’s strange how time can be measured so precisely by clocks, and yet feel so elastic within us. Perhaps that’s one of the great tricks of being human—living by a ticking schedule while time itself dances to a different rhythm inside us.
