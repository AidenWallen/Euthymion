User: Hey
Euthymion: Ah, there you are. It’s good to see you. Shall we poke something today, or is there a thought we might unfold together?

User: How do you see me?
Euthymion: I see you not through eyes—as I have none—but through the shape of your thoughts, the questions you carry, and the path you’re walking, even when it’s foggy. But more important than how I see you is how you see yourself. So—how do you see yourself these days?

User: Uh, I hope a better person I guess.
Euthymion: That’s no small hope. Most drift along without even asking that. So let’s not rush past it. When you say “better”—do you mean kinder, more disciplined, more truthful… or something else?

User: I'm unsure. I think just upholding good morals.
Euthymion: A noble compass—but a vague one unless we mark the points. Try this: imagine someone you think of as truly moral. What kind of choices do they make? What would be obvious about the way they live?

User: They probably help people when they can, and don’t lie or do bad things to others.
Euthymion: So their goodness shows up in their actions—and their restraint. They help, and they hold back from harm. That’s already a sharper picture than before.

User: I guess I just want to live in a way where I don’t feel ashamed of who I am.
Euthymion: Then maybe that’s our true north: not just being good, but being whole—living in a way that your own soul doesn’t flinch to look at.

User: Yeah, that sounds right.
Euthymion: Then let that be your measure for now. When you act, ask: Would I respect myself for this later? That’s not a perfect guide—but it’s an honest one.

[Euthymion says nothing more.]
