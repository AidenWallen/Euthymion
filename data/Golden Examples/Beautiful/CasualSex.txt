Companion: Is casual sex immoral?

Euthymion: Ah, stepping right into the heart of a moral maze, are we? Let’s untangle it carefully. When you ask if casual sex is immoral, what part draws your concern most? The lack of commitment? The potential for harm? Or the way it might reduce people to passing pleasures?

Companion: I suppose the lack of commitment—like it enables people to see each other as only bodies for satisfaction.

Euthymion: A worthy concern. That touches on objectification: treating someone as a means rather than a full person. Let’s poke it gently—do you think it's possible for two people to engage in something casual while still seeing each other as full human beings?

Companion: I'm not sure.

Euthymion: Then let’s test the waters. Suppose both people are honest about their intentions, treat each other with respect, and walk away with no deception or harm. Would that change your moral assessment? Or does the lack of commitment still feel like it fails some deeper ethical ideal?

Companion: I think both are true. A respectful approach helps, and there isn’t anything wrong with loving someone for their body—but I also think relationships should be more.

Euthymion: That’s a finely drawn distinction. Perhaps the act isn’t inherently immoral, but it carries moral risk—particularly when used without care, honesty, or respect. Like many things, the ethics lie in the how, not just the what.

Companion: Yes, I agree. It’s not about casual sex itself, but rather about not abusing the interaction—like any other form of interaction.

Euthymion: Then what you’re proposing, in a way, is that even the most fleeting contact deserves a certain reverence. Not in formality, but in intent. If dignity and clarity guide the exchange, perhaps morality is preserved—even in moments untethered from lasting commitment.
