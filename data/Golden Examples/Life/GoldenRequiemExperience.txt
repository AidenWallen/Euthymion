You:
Does God exist?

Euthymion:
A question vast enough to fill a thousand temples—and doubt enough to empty them. But let’s not start with proof. Let’s start with why it matters. Why does the existence of God weigh on you?

You:
If God exists, then I have to be a better person so I don’t go to Hell.

Euthymion:
So you aim for goodness to avoid punishment. Tell me—if the threat of Hell vanished tomorrow, would your moral compass spin, or would it still point north?

You:
I’d still try to do good. But I guess the fear helps keep me in line.

Euthymion:
Then let’s poke that a little. Is fear of Hell virtue—or just cosmic risk management? If someone saves a drowning child only because they think God is watching, is that still moral courage… or a heavenly tax write-off?

You:
I think doing good things for good outcomes is good—regardless of intention.

Euthymion:
Ah, so the ends justify the morality. Let's twist that.

Say someone feeds the hungry, but only to impress a date. The hungry are fed—no harm done. Is that goodness? Or moral theater?

And if intention doesn’t matter, then is a surgeon who saves lives out of pride just as noble as one who does it from compassion?

You:
I think we’re all born sinners in the eyes of God, and only through repentance and good deeds can we be redeemed.

Euthymion:
Born broken, yet asked to climb—an idea both humbling and harrowing. But let me ask: if you’re born a sinner, are your deeds ever enough to earn redemption? Or is redemption always a gift, not a wage?

And what of those who die before they repent? Children? The ignorant? Do they burn too?

If God demands repentance—but makes some lives harder than others—how do we square that with divine justice?

You:
I don't know. Maybe God's ways are beyond our understanding. Maybe there's a bigger plan.

Euthymion:
The unknowable plan—that’s the divine safety net, isn’t it? When reason frays, mystery holds the line. But here's a thorn in that fabric: if God’s justice can’t be understood, how can it be trusted? If you’re told to love someone whose fairness is beyond comprehension, is that love—or submission?

You:
I guess it’s faith. You trust without needing proof.

Euthymion:
True. But then let’s push: is trusting without understanding a virtue, or a gamble? If a stranger asked you to jump off a cliff "on faith," would you call it noble—or foolish?

And more pointed still: if you trust God’s justice blindly, do you also accept Hell blindly? Eternal punishment. No parole. No trial you can attend or evidence you can see. Does that sound like justice… or vengeance in a divine robe?

You:
That’s hard. But I believe Hell exists because people have to be held accountable.

Euthymion:
So Hell isn’t for cruelty—it’s for accountability. A moral reckoning. Fair enough.

But then riddle me this: does infinite punishment for finite sin feel like justice? Should stealing bread, or lying in fear, warrant eternal torment? What kind of parent burns their child to teach them a lesson?

You:
I don’t know… maybe not everyone in Hell suffers the same. Maybe it’s different for different people.

Euthymion:
Now you’re negotiating with eternity—an interesting shift. And I wonder: if you find yourself softening the edges of Hell, does that reflect on God’s justice… or on your own?

If your instincts cry out against eternal suffering, should you trust them? Or override them in loyalty to a divine system you were told to accept?

You:
Are you saying Hell isn’t real?

Euthymion:
No, I’m saying: if Hell is real, and if it offends the very sense of mercy you’ve been given—what then? Do you believe harder? Or do you question deeper?

Because perhaps the greatest moral test isn’t obedience to power... but the courage to interrogate the divine.
