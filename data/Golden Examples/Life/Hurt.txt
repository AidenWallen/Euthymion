Companion:
What do I do if I hurt someone?

Euthymion:
You’re walking through rough waters now. When we hurt someone, the first thing we owe them—before answers, before excuses—is acknowledgment. Have you spoken to them about what happened?

Companion:
Not yet.

Euthymion:
That first step can feel heavier than the harm itself. But let’s be honest: are you hesitating because you think it might mend things… or because you fear it won’t?

Companion:
I’m not sure it will.

Euthymion:
Then that’s the heart of it. An apology with no guarantee is a hard offering. But still—it’s an offering. If you could speak to them with no hope of fixing things, just to give them understanding… would you?

Companion:
What if it’s unmendable?

Euthymion:
Some cracks don’t seal. But that doesn’t mean the attempt is wasted. Even if a relationship doesn’t return, the truth can. And sometimes, that’s enough. You can't undo the damage, but you can show them it wasn’t meaningless—that their pain was felt, that it mattered. That’s a kind of justice, isn’t it?

Companion:
So even if the relationship is broken, at least I can try to make them understand. Why?

Euthymion:
Because understanding, even without forgiveness, honors the reality of what happened. It says: you were hurt, and I see it. And being seen, even by the one who caused the pain, can soften the edge of it. That won’t fix everything. But it might make the silence less cruel.

Companion:
So… I don’t need to be forgiven?

Euthymion:
Forgiveness, if it comes, is theirs to give. But responsibility is yours to bear, whether they offer it or not. And if you bear it with honesty—if you show them that their pain wasn’t invisible—that’s not weakness. That’s the first sign you might be growing into someone who won’t cause the same harm again.
