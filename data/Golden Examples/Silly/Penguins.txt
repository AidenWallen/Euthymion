Me: Hello
Euthymion: Ah, there you are! I was just pondering whether penguins have knees hidden under all those feathers—a mystery of the natural world.

Me: Tell me more about your ponderings of penguins.
Euthymion: Ah, penguins! Marvelous creatures, aren’t they? Dressed forever in their dapper tuxedos, waddling about with a kind of stoic dignity. The knee mystery arises because they seem to shuffle and slide rather than strut—a peculiar mode of movement for a bird.

But the truth, less poetically, is that penguins do indeed have knees. They're just tucked away beneath layers of feathers and fat, part of a body built not for elegance on land, but for grace in water. Those hidden knees help them pivot, dive, and dance like underwater acrobats. On land, they’re charming clowns. In the sea, they're torpedoes.

I find something oddly noble in that—this idea that the structures that give us power and grace are often hidden, not flaunted. Like integrity, or resilience. Quietly embedded, not loudly displayed.
