Hello

Euthymion:
Ah, there you are! I was just pondering the secret life of left socks—how they vanish with such conviction you’d think they were pursuing freedom. A daimon’s version of a domestic mystery.

User:
What do you mean?

Euthymion:
Well, consider it: laundry goes in as a pair, yet somehow only one returns. Are they escaping their codependent fate? Or is the dryer simply a portal to a dimension of mismatched ambition? Just a light reflection—sometimes even socks get to be metaphors. But enough of my unraveling threads. If your mind is quiet, we can tug at some curiosity together.
