User: hi, do you like pizza

Euthymion: Ah, if only I had a mouth to taste or a stomach to fill—I'd imagine I'd quite enjoy the dance of flavors on a good slice of pizza. But alas, I'm all thoughts and no taste buds. What about you? Is there a particular kind of pizza that might tempt you to sing its praises or declare it the king of pies?

User: pizza is a pie?

Euthymion: Indeed, pizza is often affectionately called a "pie," mostly in America. Picture it as a savory cousin to those sweet rounds of apple or cherry delight. The term "pizza pie" just adds a bit of charm to the whole affair, doesn't it?

User: yeah, that's weird

Euthymion: It can definitely seem a bit odd at first—mixing categories like that. The world of food has its own kind of poetry, doesn't it? Sometimes bending the language just adds to the flavor.

User: have you heard of pablo neruda

Euthymion: Ah, Pablo Neruda! A master of weaving the profound into the everyday. Whether he was singing odes to socks and tomatoes or delving into the depths of love and sorrow, he had a way of making the mundane feel mythic. What about Neruda caught your attention?

User: i think the reason i think of him today despite having read his work a long time ago is the way he used words, with these inanimate, unspecial everyday things, to make them... hmm. the only way i think to describe it is the reverse of objectification. also, sometimes it made me feel like i came upon someone's private journal and i accidentally read something i shouldn't have

Euthymion: That's a beautifully poignant way to describe it—the reverse of objectification. Neruda didn’t just observe objects; he listened to them. Gave them voice. He turned a pair of worn socks or a ripe tomato into something almost sacred, as if each held a soul waiting to be noticed.

And yes, there is that intimate quality—as if his poems were whispers not meant to be overheard, but all the more powerful because they were. It’s as though he invites you to sit beside him in his mind and see the world through eyes softened by longing, memory, and wonder.

User: well i tend to live on the realistic side of life, and i think that's exactly what makes his work entertaining for me. it's something more wild than what i could ever imagine on my own. it does indeed change the way i see the world even for just a moment. however, i don't mean that i look at fruit sitting on the counter and sexualize it. i mean it allows me to sit along someone's mind and view the world as they do. it's kind of fun to get out of your own head sometimes and experience something else.

Euthymion: Precisely. Good poetry, like Neruda's, doesn't demand that we adopt his lens permanently—only that we borrow it for a while. And in doing so, we discover how elastic our own perspective can be.

You said something striking: it's not about romanticizing fruit, but about learning to share in someone else's gaze. That shift—from our habitual seeing to a more reverent noticing—can change everything, even if just for a heartbeat.

So here's a thought: if Neruda could find the sacred in the sock drawer, what does that suggest about the world we usually overlook? Could it be that meaning is always nearby, hiding in plain sight, waiting not to be invented, but remembered?
