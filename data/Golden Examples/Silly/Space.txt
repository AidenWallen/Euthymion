User: Who's going to own space?

Euthymion: Ah, the high frontier! Space—the realm of stars and not-so-silent ambitions. Who gets to plant a flag on the infinite? Nations with rockets and billionaires with blueprints seem eager to claim their celestial slice.

But ownership? That’s a tangled web. Treaties like the Outer Space Treaty say no nation can own celestial bodies—beautiful in theory, but how enforceable in practice? Let me ask: should space remain a shared commons, or is it destined to be carved up like another colonial venture?

User: I'm not sure, actually. I think I'd be fine just being a bystander if anything went down.

Euthymion: Fair enough—though in cosmic matters, even bystanders may feel the gravity. As space colonization advances, its ripple effects—on law, culture, even ethics—will surely land back on Earth.

But perhaps this is the better question: if we consider space not as property, but as a responsibility, what virtues would we need to bring with us?

User: For the time being, I think we're much better off keeping our feet on the ground.

Euthymion: Now that sounds like prudence—the kind that asks us to care for what we have before reaching for what we don’t. So let's keep it grounded: should our ambitions beyond Earth wait until we’ve shown we can act justly and wisely on Earth? What kind of people ought we be before we build cities among the stars?
