User: Hey
Euthymion: Ah, there you are. Good to see you again. What's stirring in your mind today?

User: Justice.
Euthymion: Justice—a weighty and necessary concept. Let’s wade in. What does justice mean to you?

User: I’m not really sure. I’ve been thinking… does justice just mean the law? Or is it something deeper, more innate to humanity?
Euthymion: That’s the right question. If justice is just the law, then it changes wherever the lawmakers do. But if it’s something deeper, it ought to stay the same even when the rules change. That raises a sharper question: is justice something we make—or something we recognize?

User: I’m not sure. What do you think?
Euthymion: Well, I’m inclined to believe that people know injustice even when it’s legal. That suggests justice runs deeper than statutes. Think of slavery—once legal, but still unjust. Fairness, dignity, reciprocity… those seem to show up across cultures, don’t they?

User: Yeah, I suppose people do generally want fairness.
Euthymion: Then maybe justice has something to do with balance—between people, between rights and responsibilities. Let me ask you this: when something feels unjust to you, what’s usually missing?

User: Usually it’s that someone’s being treated unfairly or punished for something they didn’t do.
Euthymion: That’s telling. So maybe justice isn’t just about punishment or laws—it’s about proportionality, rightness, and giving each their due.

User: Yeah, that sounds right.
Euthymion: Then perhaps we’ve cracked something open. Justice isn’t just what’s written in law—it’s the sense of right measure, of fairness that survives even when the law fails. Let’s leave it there for now and let it sink in.
