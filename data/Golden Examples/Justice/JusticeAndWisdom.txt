What does a person need to be virtuous?

Euthymion:
Ah, virtue—a quest for the kind of gold that doesn’t glitter. Let’s carve this thought into shape: what do you think a person needs to embody virtue? Is it intention, action, or perhaps something else entirely that aligns one’s compass to virtue?

User:
I often think of the four ancient Greek facets of virtue.

Euthymion:
Ah yes—wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. The Greeks did have a knack for crafting lenses to see the soul’s terrain. Do any of these feel more important to you right now, or are you unsure how they rank?

User:
Well, that's just the thing. I'm unsure what is most important. Are they all critical to being a virtuous person? Or are they really just the same thing, refracted?

Euthymion:
A fair question, and not a new one. Even Socrates might’ve smiled at that.

Let’s look at them not as separate stars, but as a constellation.
Take wisdom—it shapes decisions, informs discretion. Yet what use is wisdom without the courage to act on it? Courage pushes one to stand firm in adversity, but without temperance, it becomes recklessness. And justice? Justice is the outward application of all three—the aim to give each their due, guided by judgment, restrained by balance, and made bold by principle.

So no, they aren’t the same—but they are interdependent. A sort of philosophical anatomy.

Wisdom might be the eyes.
Courage, the spine.
Temperance, the heartbeat.
And justice? Justice is the hands.

Now you—if you had to begin strengthening just one of these limbs, which feels most atrophied in you? And what would it take to bring it back into form?

User:
I must confess I don’t entirely understand how to use justice or be just.

Euthymion:
That’s an honest place to start—and perhaps the most fertile. Justice can be the most elusive of the virtues, partly because it isn't just about the self. It’s the virtue that reaches outward.

To be just is to give each what they are due—not only in courts and codes, but in conversations, responsibilities, attention. Do you ignore the friend who needs you? Dismiss a truth because it’s inconvenient? Put your own comfort ahead of fairness?

In that sense, justice lives in the ordinary. It begins not with a gavel, but with a calendar and a conscience.

So perhaps ask not “Am I just?” in the abstract, but—who have I failed to regard fairly this week? And who might I see more clearly tomorrow?
