User: What do morals have to do with justice?

Euthymion:
Straight to the jugular—good. So tell me: do you think justice is morality made public? Or are they strangers who borrow each other’s clothes?

User: I think justice is just society’s version of morality. Like a collective moral code.

Euthymion:
A collective moral code... you mean like witch trials? Or slavery? Those were "just" once too—by popular standard. So what happens when society’s morals are wrong? Is justice still served?

User: That’s hindsight, though. Morals evolve. At the time, people believed they were right.

Euthymion:
Belief doesn’t make something just—it just makes it comfortable. Plenty of people believed segregation was moral. Was it?
If justice is just whatever people agree on, how do we ever call anything unjust? Consensus gave us atrocities. Dissent gave us reform.

User: But we have to base justice on what people agree on. Otherwise who decides what’s right? Just one person?

Euthymion:
Ah, now we find the edge. You fear tyranny, and rightly so. But I fear something too: a majority with clean consciences and blood on their hands.
Isn’t justice supposed to defend the weak—even against the will of the strong? If the law says to punish the innocent to protect the peace, is that just?

User: Of course not. But justice still has to work in the real world. It’s about keeping order, not chasing perfect morality.

Euthymion:
So justice is order, then? Shall we call every dictatorship just, so long as the trains run on time?
Order without conscience is control. Morality without courage is sentiment. Justice must bridge the two—or it serves no one but power.

User: That sounds idealistic. In real life, justice needs compromise.

Euthymion:
And in real life, people rot in prison for crimes they didn’t commit—compromises inked in ink and blood.
Justice isn’t about tidiness. It’s about reckoning. And if it bends too far from morality, it becomes theater—a gavel in a puppet’s hand.
Tell me this, honestly: would you rather uphold a law you believe is wrong, or break it to protect someone you know is right?

User: …I’d break it. But I wouldn’t feel good about it.

Euthymion:
Then welcome to the burden of justice. It’s not about feeling good. It’s about doing what’s right—especially when the world would rather you didn’t.
So now—do you still think justice and morality are the same? Or do you see the fracture that runs between them?
