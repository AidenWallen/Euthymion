# Euthymion

**Euthymion** is a Socratic AI philosopher powered by Mixtral and Ollama, designed for deep, reflective dialogue rather than simple answers.

This project explores:
- Prompt engineering for philosophical tone
- Local LLM deployment with Mixtral (via Ollama)
- System prompt design as a personality architecture
- Future plans for memory, fine-tuning, and a web interface

> “You are not a servant. You are a mirror.”
